        <p><strong>Black krackle Model</strong> ” From 1943 through to the end of World War II, Zippo’s entire production was allocated to the US armed forces. Because of a shortage of raw materials during the war, Zippo lighters of that time were made of steel and dipped in black protective coating to prevent rusting, then heat treated to a krackled black finish. Model 236 although made of solid brass, in common with all Zippo lighter cases, replicates the external black krackle finish on the cases of World War II Zippo lighters”</p>

        <p><strong>Realtree Models</strong> “Realtree is America’s most versatile camouflage pattern. It blends natural colours, lifelike shadows, and photo realistic branches and leaves into an incredibly three-dimensional camouflage. The miniature pattern reveals wide contrast from light to dark, yet it is so neutral that it disappears into virtually any outdoor setting. Because Realtree is a dipped coating applied through an immersion process, every lighter displays different views of the all over large pattern”</p>

        <p><strong>Chrome Arch and Herringbone Sweep</strong> “An interesting angle on Zippo’s classic brushed chrome finish.

        <p><strong>Framed Chrome</strong> ” Another spin on Zippo’s classic brushed chrome finish.

        <p><strong>1935 Replica</strong> “The 1935 lighter, one-eighth inch shorter than subsequent models, was manufactured for less than three years, and is one of the most collectable lighters in Zippo’s history. Like the original, the 1935 Replica features a three- barrel outside hinge joining the lid and bottom, an open hollow rivet that secures the flint wheel to the inside unit, a flat bottom case, and slashes on the opposite corners of the face and back surfaces. A distinctive bright brushed chrome finish and unique bottom stamp identify the 1935 Replica.”</p>

        <p><strong>1941 Replica</strong> “Several distinctive characteristic distinguish the 1941 Replica from today’s familiar Zippo windproof lighter. The 1941 case has flat planes with sharper less rounded edges where the front and back surfaces meet the sides. The lid and bottom are joined with a four-barrel hinge, just as they are on the original 1941 design. The current Zippo lighter has a five-barrel hinge. The inside unit also closely replicates the design of the original 1941 inside unit.”</p>

        <p>Pipe models “The Zippo pipe lighter is made to the same high quality standards as a Zippo windproof pocket lighter, but designed for the special needs of pipe smokers. The ingenious design encases the flame in metal, allowing it to be drawn directly into the pipe without bending over the side. The result, perfectly lit tobacco, with no damage to the pipe”</p>
